# __Global Citizen - The Ultimate Geography Quiz | Portfolio Project II__

This is a fun game where the user can match countries with their capitals.

## Live Site

## Repository

# UX Design

## **Objective** - *Stragety Plane*

The objective while creating this multiple choice quiz game was to utilize HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to build a simple and intuitive game while providing pleasing aesthetics, interactivity and a dynamic flow for the user.

## **Features** - *Scope, skeleton & structure plane*

### **Existing Features**

- Logo

- User area

- Game area

- Footer

### **Future Features**

In the future I'd like to improve this game by adding either new windows or tabs where the user can choose the continent they want to play with and provide more questions to each continent accordingly.

### **Wireframes**

### **Colors**

I went for the aesthetics of an antique environment, like an old ship where sailors are looking at the map over an old wooden table in the dark with only a couple of candles providing light. I imagined earthy colors which represent our lands with a touch of blue which represents our seas and oceans. I found a picture on Pinterest that matched the vibe I was looking for and I pretty much went with its color palette.

### **Fonts**

I chose the **Amatic SC** and the **Cinzel** font sizes for this page. The **Amatic SC** has a little playfulness in it which complements and eases up the dominant color palette that could turn too heavy with an equally dominant font style. However, I found that it kind of disappears when I put it in the game area or on the Start button. I needed something that pops a little more, and that's when I decided to use **Cinzel** for these elements.
I imported them from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
